# Terminal Navigation Toolkit

This project is a progressive learning journey to master terminal commands so you can boost your productivity with AI.

This interface is free & open-source; however to access the 30-Day Content Commander Challenge, you'll need to purchase a lifetime API key from https://ccc.ai-captains.com

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jordanurbs/terminal-navigation-toolkit.git
   cd terminal-navigation-toolkit
   ```

2. Open up the terminal in this folder and install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

5. On the 30-Day Challenge page, enter your API key to access the challenge content.

BOOM! You'll see 30 days worth of tasks to build your own app, the Content Commander. Do it one day at a time, or do it all in one day... up to you!

## Features

- 30 days of progressive command line challenges
- Track your progress with a visual dashboard
- Earn milestone rewards as you complete challenges
- Record your learnings in a Captain's Log
- Works offline after initial setup

## What You'll Build
As you use Content Commander, you'll be building:

- Confidence with the command line
- Understanding of how APIs connect services
- The ability to read and modify code
- A foundation for using advanced tools like Cursor AI
- Your own custom tool that works exactly how YOU want it to

## From This Tool to Cursor AI and Beyond
Content Commander isn't the destination â€“ it's the first step in your journey.

Once you've mastered these basics, you'll find that tools like Cursor AI make much more sense. You'll be able to direct AI to build exactly what you need, modify what it gives you, and integrate different services.

## Privacy

Your name, the Content Commander tasks, and progress data are all stored locally on your browser. If you clear your cache, you'll lose it all!

The only time this project needs the internet is to validate the API key to fetch the Content Commander tasks from the mothership.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.

The 30-Day Content Commander Challenge is proprietary and thus requires a valid API key to access.
