# Terminal Navigation Toolkit

The confidence-building gateway that transforms command line anxiety into technical empowermentâ€”without becoming a full-stack developer.

## What Is This?

The Terminal Navigation Toolkit helps you overcome the intimidation of the command line. Whether you're a creator, entrepreneur, or builder who wants more control over your technical projects, this toolkit bridges the gap between having great AI-powered ideas and having the confidence to bring them to life.

This repo will help you start feeling comfortable with Github and running projects locally.

## What's Included

- **Getting Started Guide**: Recommended beginner's set-up for your local computer
- **Command Cheat Sheet**: Essential commands explained in plain English
- **Troubleshooting Tips**: Turn error messages from 'scary' to 'solvable'
- **30-Day Content Commander Challenge** (Premium): Build your first practical AI-powered tool step-by-step

## Getting Started

### 1. Download This Project

Clone this repo and switch into the directory (I recommend using Cursor):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jordanurbs/terminal-navigation-toolkit.git
cd terminal-navigation-toolkit
```

Don't worry if these commands look intimidating! Running them is your first step to becoming comfortable with the command line.

### 2. Install What You Need

```bash
npm install
```

This single command installs everything required to run the Terminal Nav Toolkit on your computer. It might take a minute, but you only need to do this once.

### 3. Start The Toolkit

```bash
npm run dev
```
As opposed to `npm run build`, this command will run the project in development mode. You will have to run this each time you start up again after closing your terminal running the command.

After running `npm run dev`, open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5173`

Congratulations! You've just successfully used the command line to run a real project.

No! This is about learning to work WITH code, not becoming a programmer. Think of it as learning to drive without needing to understand how to build a car.

**Who is this for?**  
Non-coders, creators, entrepreneurs, and builders who want technical confidence without becoming full-stack developers.

**How do I save my progress?**  
Your progress is automatically saved in your browser. For best results, use the same browser and device each time.
